Overview
The Priority Calculator Application is a web-based task management system designed to help users prioritize their tasks based on three criteria: Importance, Urgency, and Effort. The app evaluates tasks through a structured scoring process, enabling users to focus on high-priority items.

The application is built with Python using the Flask framework, HTML/CSS for the front-end, and SQLite for the database.

Features
Add, Update, and Delete Tasks: Users can manage their task list easily through the web interface.
Evaluate Tasks: Rate tasks on Importance, Urgency, and Effort, or compare them pairwise to generate priority scores.
Dynamic Scoring: Real-time calculation of task priority scores based on user input.
Results Display: View tasks sorted by their calculated scores to prioritize effectively.
Architecture
Backend
Framework: Flask.
Database: SQLite, with SQLAlchemy as the ORM.
Data Models:
Todo: Stores task details and their completion status.
IT_db, UT_db, ET_db: Store Importance, Urgency, and Effort scores for tasks respectively.
RT_db: Stores the aggregated Results Score for each task.
Frontend
Templates: HTML with Jinja2 templating.
Styling: CSS for a clean, user-friendly interface.
Pages:
Home Page: Add tasks and view the task list.
Evaluation Page: Rate tasks and update their scores.
Results Page: View sorted tasks based on their calculated priorities.
Key Components

Evaluation of tasks through /evaluate_tasks and /update_scores.
tasks.py:

Contains a dictionary of sample tasks (DICT_TASKS) and their DataFrame representation (df_tasks).
WEBAPP_funcs.py:

Provides utility functions for task comparison, evaluation, and ranking:
compare_tasks: Pairwise comparison of tasks.
evaluate_tasks: Individual evaluation of tasks.
render_task_rank: Calculates and sorts tasks by total priority score.
HTML Files
index_WEBAPP.html:

Displays the main task list with options to add, update, or delete tasks.
A button leads to the evaluation page.
evaluate.html:

Allows users to rate tasks on a scale from 0â€“10 for Importance, Urgency, and Effort.
Displays intermediate scores and ongoing evaluations.
results.html:

Shows sorted tasks by their aggregated Results Score.
Displays the breakdown of scores for Importance, Urgency, and Effort.
CSS Files
style.css:
General styling for the main task list and results page.
